# Resource Lists
Wherever a list of items is accepted, you can use the following resource groups to refer to them or a group of items

| Value           | Includes Materials                                                                                             |

Items that only exist in newer Minecraft versions (such as copper gear, the mace and spears) are only included on servers that have them.

## Everything, and excluding items
| Value           | Effect                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*`             | Every item in the game                                                 |
| `!<value>`      | Removes an item or group from the list, e.g. `!DIAMOND` or `!G:ARMOR`  |

Unlike name and lore filters, item lists don't support partial wildcards: `*` only works on its own, so something like `*_SWORD` won't match anything. Use a group like `G:SWORDS` instead.

Entries are applied **from top to bottom**, so an exclusion only removes items that were added above it. This means you can select everything except a group:
```yaml
items:
  - "*"              # Every item...
  - "!G:EQUIPMENT"   # ...except equipment
```

:::warning
An exclusion can only remove items that were added above it. On its own it removes nothing, and an empty list means the filter matches **every** item:
```yaml
items:
  - "!G:EQUIPMENT"   # Nothing to remove yet, so this matches every item!
```
`*` also replaces the whole list, so anything excluded *before* it is added right back:
```yaml
items:
  - "!G:EQUIPMENT"
  - "*"              # Adds equipment back. This matches every item!
```
